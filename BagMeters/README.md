# BagMeters

**No more *"This bag is full"* messages. Ever.**

## Purpose

BagMeters displays the free and total slots per bag (character and bank bags) in an attractive, easy-to-read manner. You always see which bags are full and which are not.

Current translations are available for English (default) and French.


## Configuration

BagMeters does offer a few settings for you to play with. To access them, you can either:

1. use World of Warcraft configuration panel
1. type `/bagmeters` (or just `/bm`) in your chat.


## Help

I rarely read comments here on Curse.com; should you need any help, you'd better open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Septh/WoW-BagMeters "GitHub repository"), where the projet lives.


## History

BagMeters is an original creation but it was heavilly inspired by [Bag Status Meter](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/project-99/ "Bag Status Meter"), by Madorin.


## Licence

BagMeters is released under the [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
