## Changed in v90002.1

* Make sure the ping animation is stopped when the pin frames are reused
* Remove the Death Rising rares, since the event is done
* Fix up various Bastion mobs, including making sure they're flagged as being part of the achievement
* A few past-expansion fixes: some missing positions and a toy in Pandaria, overlapping locations in Hyjal
