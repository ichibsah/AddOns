# BattlePetTabs

## [v8.3.0.200202](https://github.com/Vladinator89/wow-addon-battlepettabs/tree/v8.3.0.200202) (2020-02-02)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Vladinator89/wow-addon-battlepettabs/compare/v8.2.0.190810...v8.3.0.200202)

- TOC bump  
- Just to be super safe, ignore the travis file by name.  
- TOC bump and WoWInterface automatic packaging.  
- Added a mouseover check if the frame is forbidden. An error was introduced with the latest patch if I don't check for this when hover over different things, and your mouse lands on a nameplate for example it would error.
