-----------------------------------------------------
New in 2.0

- Save and load different minimap configs (size, position, transparancy, etc.)
- Automatic button stacking can now be disabled
- Minimap can be 'ghosted' so that clicks pass through it

Here are the new commands:

/mappy ghost Makes clicks on the minimap pass through to whatever is behind it
/mappy unghost Makes clicks on the minimap work like normal

/mappy default Loads your normal Mappy size, position, transparancy, etc.
/mappy save mysettingsname Saves the current minimap configuration under the name mysettingsname
/mappy load mysettingsname Restores the saved configuration named mysettingsname

I've included one built-in set which gatherers may find useful (I know I do). Try this:

/mappy load gather

and you will get a large, completely transparant minimap centered on your screen with clicks set to pass through it.  What this does is gives you just the yellow node dots in a HUD which makes cruising around looking for mats pretty nice.

2.0b3 Changes

- The new mini-clock is positioned correctly
- The Blizzard feedback button on WotLK is positioned correctly
- Probably other fixes too, but I'm really lazy about documenting Mappy changes, sorry about that :)

2.0b2 Changes

- The new WoW clock is positioned correctly
- Landmark arrows no longer fade with the minimap alpha
- '/mappy default' command is now '/mappy normal'
- Saved minimap configs can be loaded by using their name as a command. For example '/mappy raid' will load a saved configuration named raid (previous versions required the longer '/mappy load raid' to do the same thing)
