- Class Hall Upgrades available will now be shown even when the player's level is too low (i.e. Less than 105 for tier 2 and less than 110 for tier 3+).

- Bug fixed: Reverted recent troop detection event changes, in some situations it was causing troops to not appear in the addon.

- Artifact Research Notes on the Monitor tab now show the player's Artifact Knowledge Level in the top right corner.
- The tooltip for Artifact Research Notes has been made smarter and will now provide information like Artifact Knowledge Level and how to continue research or that you've reached the max instead of just saying "2 Ready to start".
- Bug fixed: Artifact Research Notes duration updated to 3 hr 36 min from 3 hr 35 min

- Bug fixed: Artifact Research Notes duration updated to 3 hr 35 min from 4 hr

**1.18**

**1.15**

**1.14**

- Release date: 04/24/2017
- Bug fixed: "Unexpected work order, please report to addon author on Curse: Seal of Broken Fate - 133858". Work Order icon updated to fix this issue. I'd updated this after patch 7.2 to match the new icon on the currency tab but I didn't realize the work order icon was actually still the old icon.

**1.13**

- Release date: 04/17/2017
- In order to prevent LUA errors and misinformation after changes to "Instant Complete World Quest", the data for these Cooldowns/Work Orders will be wiped on upgrade. Existing users, you'll need to log into the character to repopulate this data.
- Changes to Instant Complete World Quest:
- Change #1: Cooldown icon/time is now shown at all times instead of only when the Work Order is inactive.
- Change #2: Alert no longer applies to the 10 Min Work Order, only the 18 Hr Cooldown being Ready.
- Change #3: Work Order status is now shown in the tooltip only.
- Change #4: Work Order item count is now tracked and if you have one in your inventory it will say "1 Available" instead of "1 Ready to start".
- Change #5: Cooldown will be set to the full duration of the spell's cooldown (i.e. 18 Hrs) if the actual cooldown is unavailable in the API due to a client computer restart after the spell's use before the addon was installed. Not a new issue, just handling it differently. The issue might affect new users but last for less than a day and this is simply a workaround to prevent errors, etc.

**1.12**

- Release date: 04/13/2017
- Fixes to Instant Complete World Quest:
- Fix #1: Work Order will now also show the spell cooldown remaining in the tooltip.
- Fix #2: Cooldown remaining will continue being available after client computer restart.
- Fix #3: Alert will be trigger based on which is being shown, the Work Order or Cooldown. This avoids an alert for the cooldown firing when the Work Order is still incomplete.

**1.11**

- Release date: 04/13/2017
- Instant World Quest Complete spells will now have their cooldowns shown when there is no work order active. Exisiting users, you must log into each character to record the require info.
- Troops now sorted in descending order rather than ascending order (Troop #1, etc) for a more consistent looking display across multiple characters/classes, especially Druid.

**1.10**

- Release date: 04/09/2017

**1.09**

- Release date: 04/09/2017

Thanks alot to all the Curse users who reported information related to this bug.

**1.08**

- Release date: 04/09/2017

- Release date: 04/05/2017
- New: Option, Dock Minimap Button. You can now uncheck this option to allow dragging the Minimap button anywhere.
- Bug fixed: In some situations after upgrading from a previous version (v1.0-v1.02) and clicking on the Characters tab, you would get a LUA error. Thanks to Curse user cortx for reporting this issue.
