Adds a Chest Timer for Mythic+ Dungeons right below the Objective Tracker Main Timer.

This is a Super Strip-Down version of MythicPlusTimer.

I Didn't want to restyle the whole ObjectiveTracker for Mythic+ dungeons, and I didn't find any good addon to get the chests timers right, so I decided to create this addon.

I copied MythicPlusTimers core code that manages the timers and changed It a Lot and cleaned It up. It's mostly a new addon really, that strips down MythicPlusTimers to just a label below the Main Timer. No death counters and no Best Time Records for objectives. Just the Chests Timers in one single label. No chat command required, no configuration needed. Just install the addon, and you'll get the timers.

I do not plan to extend the functionality of this addon, but I will definately continue giving support for future changes in the game API.

If you want the restyle the Objectives frame or have deaths counter or Best Time records, I recommend using MythicPlusTimer. It's an awesome addon at that. If you just want the timers in a minimalistic fashion, this is your choice.

PS: If you can contribute to Localizing It to more languages, any help will be apreciated.
